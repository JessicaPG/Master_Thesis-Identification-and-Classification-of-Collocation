#**Automatic Identification and Classification of Collocations with Word Embeddings Master**
###### Master in Intelligent Interactive Systems Thesis (July 2019)

The objective of this thesis is to improve the current baseline results for collocation identification and lexical function classification 
with the supervised technique Support Vector Machine (SVM).
In order to do that, different experiments are conducted where several SVM multiclass classifiers are trained based on 
three main factors: dataset, operation perform over the word vectors and type of features used for training.
